# common-media-server-data
A repository to collect discussion and feedback on the Common Media Server Data proposal. The current draft document can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BlTHfbF2VGSlA4vLx1fMssWqiGWYuzhmTfQ8VeyxF8g).

Any contribution made to the issues of this repository that results in a “shall” requirement pointing to an essential patent, will require the company or individual holding the IPR to submit a Patent Holder Statement form. That form will ask the submitter to agree to make licenses available under RAND terms. Contributors are obliged to disclose to the working group any knowledge they may have of existing essential patents (or an intent to patent items whenever appropriate) affecting the work covered by this repository. 
 
Note that CTA is not responsible for identifying any patents for which a license may be required by a CTA document, nor for conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of those patents that are brought to its attention. For further IPR infomration, see Section 15 (especially 15.3) of EP-23: https://standards.cta.tech/kwspub/rules/CTA-EP-23-T.pdf.
